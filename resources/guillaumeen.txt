# Introduction
Hi, I am Guillaume and I am a new kind of teacher..
I started my career as an engineer in the nuclear industry first, then in the pharmaceutical industry, but I never got interessted in what I was doing.
What I am interessted in though, is to find solutions [link] to the major challenges of our time. Yes, I want to change the world!
Among all the challenges I care about, Education is central. I left my engineering job in the UK to become a highschool Technology teatcher in my hometown Nice, France.
From my experience as a student, then as a teacher, I come to the following conclusion: our Education system is based on the false premise that only School is capable to provide Education.
With the help of a few friends met on the Internet, I am building ZeroSchool [zeroschool.org], a peer-to-peer education system, fit for the 21st century. Come check it out!
